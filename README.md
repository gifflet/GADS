## üìñ Overview

**GADS** is a platform for **remote device control** and **Appium test execution** on mobile devices. It consists of two main components:

- **Hub**: A web interface for remote device control and provider management.
- **Provider**: Handles device setup and makes them available for remote access.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Hub Features üéØ
- üîê **Authentication System**
  - User login with session management
  - Admin user management
- üì± **Device Control**
  - Real-time video streaming (MJPEG)
  - Remote interactions: tap, swipe, text input
  - App installation/uninstallation
  - High-quality screenshots
  - Device reservation system
- üîÑ **Backend Capabilities**
  - Web interface serving
  - Provider communication proxy
  - Experimental **Selenium Grid** replacement

### Provider Features üîå
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy Setup**
  - UI-based device management
- ü§ñ **Automated Device Provisioning**
  - Per-device Appium server configuration
- üì° **Remote Control**
  - iOS streaming via [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent)
  - Android streaming via [GADS-Android-stream](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS-Android-stream)
  - Comprehensive Appium-based device interaction
- üß™ **Testing Integration**
  - Individual Appium server endpoints
  - Optional Selenium Grid 4 node registration

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ### **Prerequisites**
> Before getting started, make sure you have the following:
> - A **MongoDB** instance (v6.0 recommended)
> - Network connectivity between Hub, Providers, MongoDB, and Selenium Grid
> ---

### ‚ö° Quick Start

#### Option 1: Download the latest binary

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/shamanec/GADS/releases) and download the latest binary for your platform.

#### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shamanec/GADS

# Build the UI
cd hub/gads-ui
npm install
npm run build

# Build the application
cd ../..
go build .
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Common setup
#### üå± MongoDB
The project uses MongoDB for storing logs and for synchronization of some data between hub and providers.
You can either run MongoDB in a docker container:  
- You need to have Docker(Docker Desktop on macOS, Windows) installed.
- Execute `docker run -d --restart=always --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0`. This will pull the official MongoDB 6.0 image from Docker Hub and start a container binding ports `27017` for the MongoDB instance.
- You can use MongoDB Compass or another tool to access the db if needed.

or  
- Start MongoDB instance in the way you prefer

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Hub setup
For detailed instructions on setting up the Hub, refer to the [Hub Setup Docs](./docs/hub.md)  

#### üì± Provider setup
For detailed instructions on setting up the Provider, refer to the [Provider Setup Docs.](./docs/provider.md)

## Running GADS as a System Service
To ensure that GADS runs continuously and can be managed easily, it is recommended to execute it as a service on your operating system. Running GADS as a service allows it to start automatically on boot, restart on failure, and be managed through standard service commands.

### üêß Linux
For detailed instructions on how to create a service for Linux using systemd, please refer to the [Linux Service Documentation](./docs/linux-service.md).

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows
*Note: Service implementation for Windows is yet to be documented.*

### üçè macOS
*Note: Service implementation for macOS is yet to be documented.*

|[go-ios](https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios)| Many thanks for creating this CLI tool to communicate with iOS devices, perfect for installing/reinstalling and running WebDriverAgentRunner without Xcode |
|[Appium](https://github.com/appium)| It would be impossible to control the devices remotely without Appium for the control and WebDriverAgent for the iOS screen stream, kudos!                         |
